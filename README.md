# dclatebus

Project using wmata api to extract and visualize DC bus lateness.

I'm overhauling this project right now, the db build scripts will be found [here](https://github.com/maxgrossman/dclatebus-build) now and the viz will be found [here](https://github.com/maxgrossman/dclatebus-viz) now.

Check out the api, it rules.
